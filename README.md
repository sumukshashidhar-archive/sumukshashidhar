Hello, I'm Sumuk Shashidhar. A Grade 12 student currently studying in Bangalore at Sri Kumaran Children's Home - CBSE. Being a kid in an isolated sub-urb, the computer was often my only friend, and I started coding at the age of 9. I started out with C, moved over to Java, then to Python. These days, I find myself primarily working with Python, C++ and Javascript. 

I also love experimenting with new technologies, building projects, and working with teams to deliver the best results. 


### More about me...

- I run **[1sigmoid](https://1sigmoid.ml)**, an API solutions company which employs over 20 people and builds and maintains the sigmoidSuite of APIs for small businesses. 
- ‚òÄÔ∏è I contribute to tons of opensource projects such as **[Deno](https://deno.land)**, **[Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/)**, **[Athena](https://1athena.ml)** , **[Python Algorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)** and others. 
- ‚úçÔ∏è I blog over at **[Sumuk's Blog](https://blog.sumukshashidhar.com)**.
- üõ† I do competitive programming
- I'm well versed with **Docker, NodeJS, Tensorflow** and quite a few other frameworks. 
- I'm primarily a backend and database engineer, however, I can also work with frontend frameworks at an elementary level
- I am currently learning Graph Theory, and working with **Directed Graphs** as tools for thought
